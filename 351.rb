# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# I wanted to improve on my answer in 334:
# QUESTION 1
# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. 
# After the user is done, the program will tell the user 
# which word was entered the most frequently.
# For example, if the user enters: 
#   apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear
# The program will say: "apple was your most common word"
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)

# Ask user for 10 words and store the words in an array
words = []
puts "You will be asked for ten words. Enter some duplicates and I'll tell you which words were entered most frequently."
10.times do
  puts "Please enter a word."
  words << gets.chomp
end

# Create a hash of the word and the count
word_count = {}
words.each do |word|
  if word_count.include?(word)
    word_count[word] += 1
  else
    word_count[word] = 1
  end
end
# pp word_count

# Get the highest count
highest_count = word_count.values.max

# Lookup word by highest count
top_words = word_count.select {|word, count| count == highest_count}
# pp top_words.keys.join(", ")

# Print highest word
if highest_count == 1
  puts "There were no duplicates. All words were unique."
elsif top_words.length > 1
  puts "Theses were tied for you most common words: #{top_words.keys.join(", ")}"
else
  puts "Your most common word was #{top_words.keys.join("")}."
end


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
#   No, I referenced the lecture where Kevin counted the bad apples and felt 
#   that was a better way to solve this problem.
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
#   It would be good to have more practice counting the values of hashes.
