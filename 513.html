        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb short noodle of choice</li>
            <li>½ – 1 cup reserved pasta water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk (8 oz)</li>
            <li>6 oz shredded muenster cheese (1 ½ cups)</li>
            <li>6 oz shredded sharp cheddar cheese (1 ½ cups)</li>
            <li>4 oz shredded gruyere cheese (1 cup)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric optional, to make it extra orange!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the pasta in salted water according to instructions. When al dente, separate out 1 cup of pasta water using a mug or glass measuring cup, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot the pasta was boiling in, add the 4 tablespoon butter and 2 tablespoon flour and whisk to combine over a medium-low heat. Whisk for 1-2 minutes. Once combined, add in the milk and whisk.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese to the pot, about half at a time. Whisk to combine. Add ½ cup reserved pasta water. If you want the sauce a little looser, add additional pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add spices to the cheese sauce. I like to add garlic salt, onion powder, and turmeric. Before adding all of the noodles in, combine a small spoonful of sauce and noodles and give it a taste. Adjust until you like.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked noodles into the cheese sauce and mix until combined.</li>
        </ol>
