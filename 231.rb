# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# 2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
# For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].
strings_1 = ["hello", "goodbye"]
strings_2 = []
strings_1.each do |string|
    strings_2.append(string.upcase)
end
pp strings_2

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
#   Yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
#   I'm going to go back to doing the exercises in order. I only skipped ahead 
#   a bit because I was reading about each loops and wanted some practice.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
